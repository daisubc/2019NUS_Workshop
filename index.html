    <p class="post-entry" style="text-align: left">We are currently at the cusp of what is considered the fourth industrial revolution. This revolution is driven by the ubiquitous cyber-physical systems, algorithmic developments in artificial intelligence, gargantuan computing power, inexpensive memory and the gigantic volumes of data that are being collected. The process industries are in possession of treasure troves of heterogenous data that is gravely under utilized. The competitive global environment, and the ever increasing demands on energy, environment and quality are subjecting these industries to a high level of economic pressure. The incredible volumes of data that they already possess are poised to provide a level of automation and efficiency never seen before and thus alleviate the economic and competitive pressures.<br><br>Process industries have been using data analytics in various forms for more than three decades. In particular, statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), canonical variate analysis (CVA) and time series methods for modeling such as maximum likelihood estimation, prediction error methods have been extensively applied on industrial data. The recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence provide a new opening for using process data on large scale problems. However, in order to successfully apply machine learning methods to process data, researchers require not only a high level understanding of the algorithms but also strong programming knowledge in packages such as Python, TensorFlow, Keras and Jupyter.</p>

      <p class="post-entry biography">Prof. Venkat Venkatasubramanian is a complex dynamical systems theorist, interested in developing mathematical models of their structure, function, and behavior from fundamental principles.  He is Samuel Ruben-Peter G. Viele Professor of Engineering in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Professor of Computer Science (Affiliate), and Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (Affiliate) at Columbia University in the City of New York. He earned his Ph. D. in Chemical Engineering at Cornell, M.S. in Physics at Vanderbilt, and B. Tech. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Madras, India. He taught at Purdue University for many years, before returning to Columbia in 2011. At Columbia, Venkat directs the research efforts in the Complex Resilient Intelligent Systems Laboratory. He is also the founding Co-Director of the Center for the Management of Systemic Risk, a transdisciplinary center focused on understanding how complex systems fail in order to prevent or mitigate such failures in the future. Prof. Venkat received the Norris Shreve Award for Outstanding Teaching in Chemical Engineering three times at Purdue University. He won the Computing in Chemical Engineering Award from AIChE and is a Fellow of AIChE. In 2011, the College of Engineering at Purdue University recognized his contributions with the Research Excellence Award.  He is a past-President of the Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering (CACHE) Corporation. He currently serves as an Editor for Computers and Chemical Engineering.  His new book, “How Much Inequality is Fair? Mathematical Principles of a Moral, Optimal, and Stable Capitalist Society”, was published in 2017.
