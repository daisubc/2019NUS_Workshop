### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, registrants will be able to:
* identify and solve classification, regression, and dimensionality reduction problems.
* work with softwares such as Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.

### Introduction

**Bhushan Gopaluni, Yiting Tsai, Aditya Tulsyan, Lee Rippon** 

_**Guest Speakers: Prof. Sirish. L. Shah (University of Alberta), Prof. Richard Braatz (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)**_ 

We are currently at the cusp of what is considered the fourth industrial revolution. This revolution is driven
by the ubiquitous cyber-physical systems, algorithmic developments in artificial intelligence, gargantuan
computing power, inexpensive memory and the gigantic volumes of data that are being collected. The process
industries are in possession of treasure troves of heterogenous data that is gravely under utilized. The
competitive global environment, and the ever increasing demands on energy, environment and quality are
subjecting these industries to a high level of economic pressure. The incredible volumes of data that they
already possess are poised to provide a level of automation and efficiency never seen before and thus alleviate the economic and competitive pressures.

Process industries have been using data analytics in various forms for more than three decades. In particular,
statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), canonical
variate analysis (CVA) and time series methods for modeling such as maximum likelihood estimation, prediction
error methods have been extensively applied on industrial data. The recent developments in machine
learning and artificial intelligence provide a new opening for using process data on large scale problems.
However, in order to successfully apply machine learning methods to process data, researchers require not
only a high level understanding of the algorithms but also strong programming knowledge in packages such
as Python, TensorFlow, Keras and Jupyter.

This workshop will introduce the essential machine learning algorithms and software tools for graduate
students, experienced researchers and engineers working in the industry. Elementary knowledge of probability
and statistics is required to attend this workshop. The workshop will also feature at least two confirmed
guest speakers with decades of experience in data analytics. Prof. Sirish L. Shah of University of Alberta
and Prof. Richard D. Braatz of Massachusetts Institute of Technology have both agreed to speak during the
workshop. We have also invited an industrial guest speaker.

### Course Plan and Contents

This full day (approximately seven and half hours) workshop will be organized at the ADCHEM conference.
Starting with an elementary introduction to statistics and probability, we will develop various regression,
classification, dimensionality reduction and advanced learning algorithms that are of interest to engineers.
In addition various widely used machine learning software packages will be introduced. Registrants will solve
exercises and receive take away software code to implement these algorithms.
